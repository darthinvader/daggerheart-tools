# Schema Architecture Cleanup - ✅ COMPLETED

**User Request**: Clean up the schemas, keep only the files we want, check them out

## ✅ COMPLETED CLEANUP

### Files Kept in lib/ directory:

- ✅ `schemas/` - Complete schema architecture (5 files + tests)
- ✅ `utils.ts` - UI utilities (cn function for Tailwind CSS)
- ✅ `README.md` - Documentation
- ✅ `homebrew-enhancements.md` - Design documentation

### Files Successfully Deleted:

- ❌ ~~`daggerheartCharacter.ts`~~ - Duplicate schemas, consolidated into schemas/
- ❌ ~~`daggerheartCharacter-legacy.ts`~~ - Deprecated exports
- ❌ ~~`daggerheartValidation.ts`~~ - Superseded by schemas/validation.ts
- ❌ ~~`characterUtils.ts`~~ - Functions moved to schemas/validation.ts
- ❌ ~~`exampleCharacter.ts`~~ - Removed, tests provide examples
- ❌ ~~`test-validation.ts`~~ - Outdated test file
- ❌ ~~`__tests__/`~~ - Old tests replaced with new focused tests

### ✅ New Comprehensive Test Suite:

**91 Tests Passing** across 5 test files:

1. **`core.test.ts`** (26 tests)
   - Range bands, damage types, tiers, levels
   - Trait names, values, and validation
   - Character identity (class, ancestry, community, domain)
   - SRD trait array validation

2. **`equipment.test.ts`** (17 tests)
   - Weapon validation (traits, damage dice, burden)
   - Armor validation (thresholds, armor score)
   - Consumable types and effects
   - Inventory item flexibility

3. **`character.test.ts`** (23 tests)
   - Resource management (HP, stress, hope)
   - Character creation and validation
   - SRD compliance vs homebrew mode
   - Equipment restrictions (two-handed weapons)

4. **`validation.test.ts`** (18 tests)
   - Validation functions and error handling
   - Character creation utilities
   - Trait generation (default and SRD)
   - Tier derivation from level

5. **`index.test.ts`** (7 tests)
   - Export completeness verification
   - Integration testing between modules
   - End-to-end character creation workflow

### ✅ Clean Schema Architecture:

**schemas/core.ts** - Base types and primitives

- Range bands, damage types, tiers, levels
- Trait system and validation
- Character identity enums and schemas

**schemas/character.ts** - Character creation and validation

- Resource schemas (HP, stress, hope)
- Main PlayerCharacterSchema with conditional validation
- SRD compliance enforcement

**schemas/equipment.ts** - Equipment and inventory

- Weapon and armor schemas
- Consumable and inventory item schemas
- Trait and range integration

**schemas/validation.ts** - Utility functions

- Character validation (SRD and homebrew)
- Character creation helpers
- Error handling and reporting

**schemas/index.ts** - Clean export barrel

- All schemas, types, and utilities exported
- Single import point for consumers

## ✅ Results Summary:

**Before**:

- 8 TypeScript files with duplicated schemas
- Outdated test files
- Mixed concerns and unclear architecture

**After**:

- 4 core schema files + 1 export file
- 91 comprehensive tests (100% passing)
- Clean separation of concerns
- Zero duplication
- Strong type safety with runtime validation

**Tech Debt Eliminated**:

- ✅ Removed 2,000+ lines of duplicate code
- ✅ Consolidated scattered validation logic
- ✅ Eliminated unused schemas and functions
- ✅ Replaced outdated tests with comprehensive coverage
- ✅ Simplified import structure

The schemas are now production-ready with excellent test coverage and clean architecture following Universal Janitor principles of "less code = less debt".
