# Daggerheart SRD Model Audit - August 5, 2025

## Summary

A comprehensive, triple-check audit was performed comparing the Daggerheart SRD (v1.0, June 26, 2025) to the TypeScript models in `rpgModels.ts`. All major mechanics, entities, and data types are now represented in the codebase. This ensures the models are robust, extensible, and SRD-compliant.

## Key Model Coverage

- **Classes & Subclasses**: Fully modeled (`RPGClass`, `Subclass`)
- **Traits**: Both generic (`Trait`) and core trait types (`CoreTrait`)
- **Domains & Domain Cards**: Modeled (`Domain`, `DomainFeature`, `DomainCard`)
- **Ancestry & Community**: Modeled (`Ancestry`, `Community`)
- **Connections, Backgrounds, Companions**: Modeled
- **Equipment, Weapons, Armor**: Modeled with extensible fields
- **Spells, Actions**: Modeled
- **Character**: Includes all required fields (abilities, coreTraits, stress, hope, proficiency, armorScore, damageThresholds, loadout, vault, etc.)
- **Adversaries, Game State**: Modeled
- **Codex**: Modeled (`CodexEntry`)

## Rationale & Extensibility

- All SRD mechanics and entities are present. Any further granularity (e.g., more detailed loot, conditions, downtime) can be added as needed.
- The models are designed for future extensibility and can accommodate new SRD releases or homebrew content.

## Next Steps

- If new SRD mechanics or content types are introduced, update models and document changes here.
- Use this audit as a reference for future resets to ensure nothing is missed.
