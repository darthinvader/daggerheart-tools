# Progress Report - Daggerheart Tools

## What's Working

### Core Data Layer ✅

- **Complete Domain System**: All 9 domains implemented with 200+ cards
  - Arcana, Blade, Bone, Codex, Grace, Midnight, Sage, Splendor, Valor
  - Each card includes name, level, type, recall cost, and full description
  - Type-safe schema validation for all domain cards
  - Consistent export patterns across all domain files

- **Comprehensive Class System**: All 9 classes with subclasses
  - Bard (Troubadour, Wordsmith)
  - Druid (Warden of Elements, Warden of Renewal)
  - Guardian (Stalwart, Vengeance)
  - Ranger (Beastbound, Wayfinder)
  - Rogue (Nightwalker, Syndicate)
  - Seraph (Divine Wielder, Winged Sentinel)
  - Sorcerer (Elemental Origin, Primal Origin)
  - Warrior (Call of the Brave, Call of the Slayer)
  - Wizard (School of Knowledge, School of War)

- **Level Progression System**: Point-based advancement
  - 2 points per level with configurable costs
  - Tier-based features (Foundation → Specialization → Mastery)
  - Multiclassing support with proper restrictions
  - Automatic benefit tracking (experience, proficiency, rally dice)

- **Character Foundation**: Core character systems
  - 6 trait system (Agility, Strength, Finesse, Instinct, Presence, Knowledge)
  - 18 ancestries with unique abilities
  - 9 communities with distinct features
  - Hit points, stress, armor, and resource management

### Development Infrastructure ✅

- **Type Safety**: Zod schemas with TypeScript inference
- **Build System**: Vite with hot reloading and optimization
- **Code Quality**: ESLint, Prettier, and pre-commit hooks
- **Testing Setup**: Vitest with coverage reporting
- **Package Management**: pnpm with workspace configuration

   - Level-up interface with point allocation

3. **Data Persistence**
   - Character save/load functionality
   - Import/export character data
   - Local storage or IndexedDB integration
   - Character version history tracking

### Medium-term Goals (Sprint 2-3)

4. **Advanced Features**
   - Multiclassing interface and validation
   - Companion management for Rangers
   - Equipment and inventory system
   - Experience and progression tracking

5. **User Experience**
   - Mobile-responsive design
   - Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
   - Error handling and user feedback
   - Help system and rule references

6. **Performance & Polish**
   - Code splitting and lazy loading
   - Bundle size optimization
   - Animation and transition polish
   - Cross-browser testing

### Future Enhancements (Sprint 4+)

7. **Extended Functionality**
   - Campaign management tools
   - Party coordination features
   - Homebrew content support
   - Print-friendly character sheets

8. **Advanced Integrations**
   - Dice rolling integration
   - Digital asset management
   - Community sharing features
   - API for third-party tools

## Current Status

### Completion Metrics

- **Data Layer**: ~90% complete (schemas and validation)
- **Game Rules**: ~95% complete (official SRD implementation)
- **UI Components**: ~5% complete (basic routing only)
- **Features**: ~15% complete (foundation only)
- **Testing**: ~20% complete (schema tests exist)

### Technical Health

- **Type Safety**: Excellent (full TypeScript coverage)
- **Code Quality**: Good (linting and formatting enforced)
- **Performance**: Unknown (no UI load testing yet)
- **Accessibility**: Not started
- **Mobile Support**: Not started

## Known Issues

### Data Layer Issues

- Some domain card descriptions may need formatting improvements
- Character progression edge cases need testing
- Validation error messages could be more user-friendly

### Development Issues
