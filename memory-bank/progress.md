# Progress Report - Daggerheart Tools

Updated: August 9, 2025

## What's Working

### Core Data Layer

- Domain System: 9 core domains implemented under `src/lib/data/domains/*` with type-safe validation via `schemas/domains.ts`.
- Class System: 9 classes with subclasses; unified subclass schema; Ranger companion support.
- Identity & Core: Consolidated `core.ts` and `identity.ts`; shared helpers reduce duplication.
- Equipment: Unified equipment schemas in `schemas/equipment.ts`; data present in `src/lib/data/equipment/*`.

### Development Infrastructure

- Type Safety: TypeScript strict + Zod. Type-check passes today.
- Build System: Vite. Build path compiles locally.
- Quality: ESLint/Prettier, tests configured with Vitest (coverage present).

## What's Left to Build

Immediate priorities

1. Character creation UI
2. Character sheet interface
3. Data persistence (localStorage/IndexedDB)

Medium-term 4. Advanced features (multiclassing UI, companion mgmt, inventory) 5. UX polish (mobile, a11y, feedback) 6. Performance/code-splitting and bundle budget

Future 7. Campaign tools, party coordination, homebrew support, print views 8. Integrations (dice, sharing, APIs)

## Current Status

Estimated completion

- Data Layer: ~90%
- Rules Data: ~95%
- UI: ~5%
- Features: ~15%
- Tests: ~20%

Technical health

- Type safety: Excellent
- Lint/format: Good
- Performance/Mobile/A11y: Not yet assessed

## Known Issues

- Some domain descriptions need formatting polish
- Edge cases in progression need tests
- Persistence and UI are not started

## MVP Success Criteria

- [ ] End-to-end character creation (identity → class → traits → domains)
- [ ] Character sheet with core interactions
- [ ] Level-up with points
- [ ] Save/load characters
- [ ] Mobile-friendly layout

## Next Milestone

Target: Character creation UI scaffold
Timeline: 2–3 weeks
Deliverables: creation wizard, basic sheet, validation + error UX, local storage

## Recent Progress Log

- Audited codebase vs memory bank; aligned paths and scope (domain data in data/domains).
- Ran type-check: PASS. Build path compiles.
- Verified `PlayerCharacterSchema` and equipment/domain schemas exist and are consistent.
