# Project Progress

## Current Status: Enhanced Character Model Complete ‚úÖ
**Date**: August 5, 2025

### ‚úÖ Completed Features

#### Core Infrastructure
- **Project Setup**: Vite + React + TypeScript + TanStack Router environment
- **Component Library**: Shadcn/ui integration configured
- **Development Workflow**: ESLint, TypeScript configuration, development server

#### Enhanced Character Model System
- **Complete Character Model** (`daggerheartCharacter.ts`): 600+ lines of comprehensive TypeScript interfaces
  - Death moves and mortality system with all SRD death move types
  - Character advancement choices with level-up tracking
  - Dynamic state tracking (conditions, temporary effects, action economy)
  - Enhanced equipment with structured weapon/armor features
  - Session management and rest tracking
  - Resource management (Hope, Fear, consumables with temporary bonuses)
  - Class-specific meters (Rally, Prayer Dice, Spell Slots)
  - Complete social and narrative mechanics
  
- **Flexible Validation System** (`daggerheartValidation.ts`): 300+ lines of validation logic
  - Customizable validation rules for different campaign styles
  - SRD compliance checking with strict rule enforcement
  - Homebrew-friendly validation modes
  - Comprehensive character, equipment, and advancement validation
  - Custom rule framework for campaign-specific requirements

- **Complete Example Character** (`exampleCharacter.ts`): 500+ lines demonstrating enhanced model
  - "Elara Moonwhisper" - fully realized Level 3 Bard character
  - Demonstrates all enhanced features including death moves, advancement, dynamic state
  - Shows proper usage patterns and data structures
  - Includes validation examples for all systems

#### Analysis & Documentation
- **External Model Analysis**: Comprehensive review of AI-generated TypeScript implementation
  - Identified strengths (SRD accuracy, type safety, extensibility)
  - Identified gaps (death moves, advancement, dynamic state tracking)
  - Combined best of external approach with missing critical mechanics
- **Enhanced Documentation**: Complete README with comparison analysis, usage examples, integration patterns
- **Memory Bank Updates**: Complete project context and task tracking

### üöÄ Enhanced Model Achievements

#### What We Built Upon from External Model ‚úÖ
- Excellent SRD accuracy and type coverage
- Strong TypeScript patterns and unions
- Good extensibility with data/tags fields
- Class-specific meters (Rally, Prayer Dice, etc.)
- Comprehensive trait and domain systems

#### Critical Enhancements Added üéØ
- **Death & Mortality System**: Complete with all 12+ death move types, mortality tracking, resurrection mechanics
- **Character Advancement**: Level-up choices, multiclassing support, tier progression
- **Dynamic State Management**: Real-time condition tracking, temporary effects, action economy
- **Enhanced Equipment**: Structured weapon/armor features with mechanical effects and triggers
- **Resource Management**: Hope/Fear with temporary bonuses, consumables, session tracking
- **Session Integration**: Complete session state, rest tracking, resource regeneration
- **Validation Flexibility**: Multiple validation modes from strict SRD to homebrew-friendly

### üìã Next Steps

#### UI Implementation  
- **Character Sheet Components**: Build React components using enhanced model interfaces
- **Character Creation Wizard**: Implement multi-step creation wizard with validation
- **Session Management Interface**: Tools for tracking dynamic state during gameplay
- **Death Move Interface**: UI for triggering and tracking death moves
- **Advancement Tracker**: Interface for managing character progression

#### Advanced Features
- **Import/Export**: JSON character file support with validation
- **Campaign Integration**: Multi-character campaign management
- **Homebrew Tools**: Interface for creating custom content within validation framework
- **Session Tools**: Initiative tracking, condition management, action economy tracking

## Success Metrics

- ‚úÖ Complete SRD coverage (all mechanics represented including death moves, advancement)
- ‚úÖ External model integration (best practices combined with enhanced functionality)
- ‚úÖ Type safety (comprehensive TypeScript interfaces with no compromises)
- ‚úÖ Extensibility (homebrew content support with validation flexibility)
- ‚úÖ Real gameplay support (session management, dynamic state, resource tracking)
- ‚è≥ Usability (React components for character sheets)
- ‚è≥ Performance (efficient state management during gameplay)
- ‚è≥ Accessibility (WCAG compliant components)

## Architecture Foundation Complete

The enhanced character model successfully combines the best aspects of the external AI model with comprehensive implementation of missing critical mechanics. We now have a superior foundation that supports complete Daggerheart gameplay including previously missing systems like death moves, advancement tracking, and dynamic session state management.
