# [TASK013] - Trim Inventory Card

**Status:** Completed  
**Added:** 2025-08-14  
**Updated:** 2025-08-14

## Original Request

Reduce `src/components/characters/inventory-card.tsx` size/complexity by extracting small presenters and wiring them in with behavior parity.

## Thought Process

Inventory card had duplicated badge/chip markup and a large list section. Splitting the quick summary chips and the list into self-contained presenters would simplify the card and enable reuse elsewhere.

## Implementation Plan

- Create `InventorySummaryChips` presenter for slots/items/free + category counts
- Create `InventoryList` presenter for the scrollable list UI with controls
- Refactor `inventory-card.tsx` to consume both presenters
- Keep handlers and logic identical via props; validate with tests

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** Completed - 100%
