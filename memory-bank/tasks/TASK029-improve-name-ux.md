# TASK029 - Improve header name UX

**Status:** Completed  
**Added:** 2025-08-16  
**Updated:** 2025-08-16

## Original Request

"Set a name" isnâ€™t intuitive. Create a task, plan a fix, and implement it.

## Thought Process

The header currently shows a button with a placeholder string "Set a name" when the character has no name. Users found this phrasing unclear. The action is an edit/add action, so the copy should reflect that. We can improve clarity by:

- Using more common copy like "Add a name" or "Enter a name".
- Adjusting the accessibility label to reflect the state (Add vs Edit).
- Keeping the existing tap-to-edit behavior and hover underline to preserve affordance.

## Implementation Plan

- Replace placeholder text "Set a name" with clearer copy ("Add a name").
- Change title tooltip fallback from "Set a name" to "Add a name".
- Make aria-label dynamic: "Add name" when empty, "Edit name" when present.
- Keep styles and behavior unchanged to avoid layout/test regressions.
- Run typecheck and tests.

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** Completed - 100%
