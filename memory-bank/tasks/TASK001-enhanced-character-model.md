# [TASK001] - Create Enhanced Daggerheart Character Model

**Status:** In Progress  
**Added:** 2025-08-05  
**Updated:** 2025-08-05

## Original Request

User asked to learn from an external AI's proposed Daggerheart TypeScript character model and improve our implementation.

## Thought Process

After analyzing the external model against the SRD, I identified:

**External Model Strengths:**

- Excellent SRD accuracy with proper type unions
- Comprehensive core mechanics (traits, classes, domains, equipment)
- Strong extensibility patterns with data/tags fields
- Class-specific meters (Rally, Unstoppable, Prayer Dice, Slayer)
- Good builder/helper function patterns

**Critical Gaps to Address:**

- Death moves and character mortality system
- Level advancement choices and multiclassing mechanics
- Dynamic state tracking (conditions, temporary effects, session state)
- Fear system and action economy representation
- Enhanced equipment features as structured objects
- Social/narrative systems depth

**Our Approach:**
Use their excellent foundation but enhance with missing mechanics while maintaining their type safety and extensibility patterns.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Core Foundation** - Build enhanced character interface from external model
2. **Missing Mechanics** - Add death moves, advancement, dynamic state systems
3. **Validation Layer** - Implement flexible validation with SRD compliance
4. **Helper Utilities** - Character creation, manipulation, and calculation functions
5. **Example Characters** - Demonstrate capabilities and usage patterns
6. **Integration Points** - Connect to React/Vite application framework

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** In Progress - 0%
