# TASK014 - Trim Community Drawer

**Status:** Completed  
**Added:** 2025-08-15  
**Updated:** 2025-08-15 (later)

## Original Request

Proceed with next refactor targets and continue refactoring; check tasks and update statuses. Community drawer is a top offender by size/complexity. Extract presenters/hooks to slim it while preserving behavior and tests.

## Thought Process

- Current `community-drawer.tsx` mixes local draft state, filtering, list rendering, and homebrew form inputs in one file.
- Following our presenter extraction pattern (as done for inventory-card and thresholds-inline), we can split:
  - `CommunityList` — scrollable list with search, badges, selected preview
  - `HomebrewCommunityForm` — controlled inputs for name/feature/description
- Keep commit/save logic in the parent and pass draft via props.

## Implementation Plan

- Extract CommunityList presenter
- Extract HomebrewCommunityForm presenter
- Refactor `community-drawer.tsx` to use them
- Validate with tests and typecheck; refresh analyzer snapshot

## Acceptance Criteria

- No behavior changes; Save disabled until valid; switching tabs syncs mode correctly
- Typecheck PASS; full test suite PASS
- `community-drawer.tsx` size/LOC reduced and no longer a top offender

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** Completed - 100%

## Progress Log

### 2025-08-15

- Task created. Plan defined to split list and homebrew form into presenters. Parent will keep commit/save logic.

### 2025-08-15 (later)

- Implemented `CommunityList` and `HomebrewCommunityForm` presenters and wired them in `community-drawer.tsx`. Full test suite PASS, typecheck PASS. Analyzer top list no longer includes `community-drawer.tsx`, confirming reduction. Closing task.
