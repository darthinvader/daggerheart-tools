# [TASK001] - Complete lib schema system

**Status:** In Progress
**Added:** August 7, 2025
**Updated:** August 7, 2025

## Original Request

Update and document the comprehensive library schema system including domain cards, class systems, and character progression for the Daggerheart Tools project.

## Thought Process

The lib system represents the core data layer of the application, built around type-safe Zod schemas that validate all game rules and character data. The system is organized into two main areas:

1. **Domain System** (`/src/lib/domains/`): Complete implementation of all 9 core domains with 200+ domain cards
2. **Schema System** (`/src/lib/schemas/`): Character and class validation schemas with progression rules

This foundational work enables type-safe character creation, validation, and management throughout the application.

## Implementation Plan

- [x] Domain card system with all 9 domains
- [x] Class system with all 9 classes and subclasses
- [x] Level progression and point allocation system
- [x] Character trait and identity systems
- [ ] Final character schema integration
- [ ] Cross-validation between systems
- [ ] Performance optimization for large schemas

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** In Progress - 85% Complete

## Progress Log

### August 7, 2025

- Documented complete domain system with all 9 core domains
- All domain cards include full SRD details (name, level, type, recall cost, description)
- Implemented comprehensive class system with all 9 classes and 18 subclasses
- Built level progression system with point-based advancement
- Created character identity system with ancestries and communities
- Established tier-based feature progression (Foundation → Specialization → Mastery)
- Added companion system for Ranger Beastbound subclass
- Set up schema composition patterns with discriminated unions
- Implemented const assertions for all game data immutability
- Created memory bank documentation for long-term project context

The core schema foundation is nearly complete, with only final integration testing and performance optimization remaining before moving to UI development.
