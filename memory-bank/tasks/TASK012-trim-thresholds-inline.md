# TASK012 - Trim Thresholds Inline Editor

**Status:** Completed  
**Added:** 2025-08-14  
**Updated:** 2025-08-15

## Original Request

Slim down `src/components/characters/thresholds-inline.tsx` by extracting presentational chunks and any reusable logic hooks while keeping behavior identical. Validate with tests and typecheck; measure size.

## Thought Process

- Extract UI into small presenters to keep thresholds-inline thin and reusable.
- Keep business logic in hooks and helpers (useThresholdsSettings, thresholds-format).

## Implementation Plan

- Add `components/characters/thresholds/ThresholdsButtonsRow.tsx`
- Add `components/characters/thresholds/ThresholdsSettingsPanel.tsx`
- Refactor `thresholds-inline.tsx` to consume them
- Validate tests and typecheck; run size report

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** Completed - 100%

## Progress Log

### 2025-08-14

- Created presenters `ThresholdsButtonsRow.tsx` and `ThresholdsSettingsPanel.tsx` under `src/components/characters/thresholds/`.
- Refactored `src/components/characters/thresholds-inline.tsx` to consume them; removed duplicated inline UI.
- Adjusted presenter props to align to `ThresholdsSettings` and string-based display values from the hook.

### 2025-08-15

- Validated with repeated test runs: PASS (49/49). Typecheck shows no new diagnostics.
- Ran size report to confirm reductions and new module entries. Nested form warnings in ancestry tests are intermittent; `HomebrewAncestryForm` uses a group div, not a form.
