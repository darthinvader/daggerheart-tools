# TASK016 - Trim Inventory Library Results List

**Status:** Completed  
**Added:** 2025-08-15  
**Updated:** 2025-08-15

## Original Request

Continue refactoring top offenders. `inventory-drawer/library-results-list.tsx` is ~9.2 KB with high complexity. Reduce complexity and size by extracting tiny presenters and pure helpers without changing behavior.

## Thought Process

- The component handles actions (add/decrement/toggle) plus heavy UI composition, cost calculation, emoji/category mapping, and feature list rendering.
- Splitting UI bits into small presentational components will improve readability and testability without changing props API.

## Implementation Plan

- Extract `ItemActions` presenter for the quantity/equip/remove controls (receives selected state, qty, equipped flags, and callbacks).
- Extract `ItemBadges` presenter for Tier/Rarity/Cost chips (uses existing `estimateItemCost`).
- Extract `ItemFeatures` presenter for the features preview list.
- Move `emojiFor(item)` to a pure `emojiForItem` helper function exported locally for reuse and test.
- Keep `LibraryResultsList` props and behavior identical.
- Validate with full tests and typecheck; re-run analyzer to record deltas.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Visual output and behaviors unchanged (tests remain green).
- Typecheck PASS; test suite PASS.
- File size and/or complexity reduced meaningfully.

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** Completed - 100%
