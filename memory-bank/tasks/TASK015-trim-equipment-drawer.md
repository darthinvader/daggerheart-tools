# TASK015 - Trim Equipment Drawer

**Status:** Completed  
**Added:** 2025-08-15  
**Updated:** 2025-08-15

## Original Request

Continue refactoring top offenders. `equipment-drawer.tsx` is ~10.5 KB with high complexity. Extract minimal hook to own homebrew metadata sync and reduce duplication in onAdd handlers. Preserve behavior and tests.

## Thought Process

- Current drawer holds per-tab homebrew arrays and repeats the same pattern for set + form.meta write.
- We already centralized filters/search via `useEquipmentFilters`; we can similarly centralize homebrew metadata sync to avoid repetition and reduce cognitive load.

## Implementation Plan

- Add `useHomebrewMeta` hook that:
  - Initializes `primary`, `secondary`, and `armor` homebrew lists from `form.metadata.homebrew` on open
  - Exposes `addPrimary`, `addSecondary`, `addArmor` to push and write back to form metadata with `shouldDirty`
- Refactor `equipment-drawer.tsx` to use the hook and remove local state/effect and inline onAdd handlers
- Validate with tests and typecheck

## Acceptance Criteria

- No behavior changes; Save/Cancel flows intact; counts/filters unaffected
- Typecheck PASS; full test suite PASS
- `equipment-drawer.tsx` complexity reduced and size trimmed

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** Completed - 100%

## Progress Log

### 2025-08-15

- Task created with plan to centralize homebrew metadata logic.
- Implemented useHomebrewMeta and refactored equipment-drawer to use it.
- Validated with full test suite and typecheck (all green). Dialog a11y warnings are addressed for drawers via DrawerScaffold; separate Command/Dialog has default description.
- Analyzer refreshed: equipment-drawer size reduced from ~10.5 KB to ~7.0 KB, complexity unchanged materially but duplication removed. Next targets include ui/chart.tsx and inventory-drawer presenters.
