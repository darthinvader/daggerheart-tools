# Active Context

## Current Task: Schema Architecture Cleanup (August 2025)

Successfully completed major schema refactoring to eliminate over-engineering and improve maintainability.

## Recent Accomplishments

**Schema Cleanup Completed:**

- ✅ Removed unnecessary factory classes (CharacterFactory, CharacterValidator)
- ✅ Consolidated duplicate SRD/Homebrew schemas into single conditional schema
- ✅ Simplified validation.ts from 196 lines to 80 lines of actual utility
- ✅ Streamlined core.ts by removing excessive constants and comments
- ✅ Extracted character utility functions to separate file
- ✅ Updated systemPatterns.md with new architecture decisions

**Performance Improvements:**

- Eliminated object instantiation overhead from factory patterns
- Reduced schema parsing complexity
- Removed redundant validation layers

## Next Steps

**Phase 2: Testing and Validation**

1. Run existing tests to ensure refactoring didn't break functionality
2. Update any dependent code that used old factory patterns
3. Validate character creation still works correctly

**Phase 3: Documentation Updates**

1. Update any API documentation referencing old patterns
2. Create migration guide for breaking changes
3. Update README with simplified usage examples

## Key Decisions Made

- **Single Schema Approach**: Conditional validation based on `homebrewMode` flag instead of separate schemas
- **Function-First**: Replaced classes with simple functions for better tree-shaking and simplicity
- **Utility Separation**: Moved calculation functions out of schema files for better organization
- **Minimal Abstraction**: Direct use of Zod instead of wrapping it in unnecessary layers

## Current State

Schema architecture is now clean, maintainable, and follows modern TypeScript patterns. Ready to proceed with testing and integration work.
