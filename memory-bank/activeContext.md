# Active Context

## Current Task
Creating enhanced Daggerheart character model by learning from external TypeScript implementation and improving upon it.

## Immediate Plan
**Phase 1: Foundation** (Next)
1. Create enhanced character model combining external model strengths with identified gaps
2. Implement missing critical mechanics (death moves, advancement, dynamic state)
3. Add strong TypeScript validation with flexible rules
4. Build example characters demonstrating capabilities

**Phase 2: Integration**
1. Connect models to React components
2. Build character creation wizard
3. Implement character sheet interface
4. Add save/load functionality

## Key Insights from Analysis
**External Model Strengths:**
- Excellent SRD accuracy and core type coverage
- Strong TypeScript patterns and extensibility
- Good class-specific meters (Rally, Prayer Dice, etc.)

**Critical Gaps to Address:**
- Death moves and character mortality system
- Level advancement choices and multiclassing
- Dynamic state tracking (conditions, sessions)
- Fear system and action economy
- Enhanced equipment features and consumables

## Implementation Strategy
Start with external model as foundation, then systematically add missing mechanics while maintaining their excellent type safety and extensibility patterns.
