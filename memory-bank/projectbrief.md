# Project Brief

## Core Goal
Build comprehensive TypeScript models for Daggerheart SRD that are both SRD-accurate and extensible for homebrew content.

## Context
- **Current State**: No actual character model implementation exists in workspace
- **Previous Work**: Memory bank references prior `rpgModels.ts` implementation (now missing)
- **External Input**: User provided another AI's TypeScript character model as reference
- **SRD Sources**: Complete SRD documentation available in `SRD/` folder

## Requirements
1. **SRD Accuracy**: Model must represent all core Daggerheart mechanics faithfully
2. **Type Safety**: Strong TypeScript interfaces with comprehensive validation
3. **Extensibility**: Support homebrew content without breaking core functionality
4. **Usability**: Clear, well-documented interfaces for character creation and manipulation
5. **Integration**: Compatible with web application framework (React/Vite/TanStack Router)

## Scope
- Character creation and management system
- Class, ancestry, community, and domain modeling
- Equipment and progression systems
- Validation and helper utilities
- Example characters and usage patterns
