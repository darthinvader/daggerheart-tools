Leveling Up
When your party reaches a milestone in a campaign, the GM will tell you that it’s time to level
up. How often this happens is up to your GM and your group’s narrative preferences, but most
groups play at least three sessions between levels.
OVERVIEW
All party members level up at the same time. When you level
up your character, you can upgrade their character traits
and features. The following sections provide step-by-step
instructions for leveling up a character.
Generally, characters begin their journey at level 1 and end their
journey at level 10, but if a party loses a character in the middle
of a campaign, the GM should have the character's player make
a new character at the appropriate level of the party.
TIERS OF PLAY
Levels in Daggerheart are divided into tiers.
→ Tier 1 encompasses level 1 only.
→ Tier 2 encompasses levels 2–4.
→ Tier 3 encompasses levels 5–7.
→ Tier 4 encompasses levels 8–10.
Your tier affects your damage thresholds, level achievements,
and more.
LEVEL ACHIEVEMENTS
When your character levels up, first take any level
achievements they have earned. These achievements are
given in at the top of the tier block, found on the lower half of
your class guide.
• At level 2, you gain an additional Experience and add it to
your character sheet with a modifier of +2. You also gain a
permanent +1 bonus to your Proficiency.
• At level 5, you gain an additional Experience and add it to
your character sheet with a modifier of +2. You also gain
a permanent +1 bonus to your Proficiency. You clear any
marks on each character trait you’ve previously increased
and marked, allowing you to increase those traits again
later.
• At level 8, you gain an additional Experience and add it to
your character sheet with a modifier of +2. You also gain
a permanent +1 bonus to your Proficiency. You clear any
marks on each character trait you’ve previously increased
and marked.
Tip: For help with Experiences, see the “Step 7: Create Your
Experiences” section on page 20.

CHOOSING ADVANCEMENTS
Next, you have a set list of options for upgrading your character. You can choose any two options with unmarked slots. Some
options have multiple slots, meaning they can be chosen more than once. When you choose your advancement, mark the
appropriate slot. Once all of an option’s slots have been marked, you can’t take that option again.TIER 4:,ū.ff.ūffi,5294
At level 8, gain an additional
Experience at +2 and clear all marks
on character traits. Then gain a
+1 bonus to your Proficiency.
Then work with the GM to generate two starting Experiences for your character.

• When you choose to increase two unmarked character
traits and mark them: Choose two unmarked character
traits and gain a permanent +1 bonus to them. You can’t
increase these stats again until the next tier (when your
level achievement allows you to clear those marks).
• When you choose to permanently add 1 or more Hit Point
slots: Darken the outline of the next rectangle in the
Hit Point section of your character sheet in pen or
permanent marker.
• When you choose to permanently add 1 or more Stress
slots: Darken the outline of the next rectangle in the
Stress section of your character sheet in pen or

• When you choose to increase an Experience: Choose
an Experience on your character sheet and gain a
permanent +1 bonus to it.
• Take an additional domain card of your level or lower from
a domain you have access to: You can choose an additional

lower. If you have multiclassed, select a card from your
chosen domain at no higher than half your level.
• When you choose to increase your Evasion:
Gain a permanent +1 bonus to your Evasion.
• When you choose to take an upgraded subclass card:
Take the next card for your subclass. If you have only
the foundation card, take a specialization. If you have a
specialization already, take a mastery. You’ll also cross out
the option to multiclass when you subsequently level up in
that tier.
• When you choose to increase your Proficiency: Fill in one
of the open circles in the “Proficiency” section of your
character sheet, then increase your weapon’s number of
damage dice by 1 (for example, from 2d6 to 3d6). You’ll
see a black box around the level-up slots. That is because
increasing your Proficiency requires you to mark both
level-up slots in order to take it as an option.
• When you choose to multiclass: You can take certain
features and domain cards from another class. You’ll see
a black box around the level-up slots. That is because
multiclassing requires you to mark both level-up slots
in order to take it as an option. See the upcoming
“Multiclassing” section for details.agility

RAISING DAMAGE THRESHOLDS
After choosing advancements, raise your character’s damage
thresholds by +1 (since you always add their current level to
their damage thresholds).
TAKING DOMAIN CARDS
Finally, take a new domain deck card at your level or lower,
increasing the special abilities your character can use. You can
choose one card from any domain deck available to your class.
If you share a domain deck with another player, make sure
you take each other’s preferences into consideration when
choosing a card, or that you have multiple copies of a card
available.
Additionally, you can also choose to trade out one domain
card you already have for a different domain card of an equal
level or lower.
Since you can’t have more than five domain cards active at a
time, once you have six or more domain cards, you need to
choose which to keep in your loadout and which to store in
your vault.
MULTICLASSING
Starting at level 5, you can choose multiclassing as an option
when leveling up. When you multiclass, you get to choose an
additional class, select one domain from that class, and gain
access to their class feature. Take the appropriate multiclass
module and add it to the right side of your character sheet,
then choose a foundation card from a subclass of your
choice. If that foundation card has a Spellcast trait on it, you
can choose to use that trait when making a Spellcast Roll or
use the Spellcast trait from your original subclass. If you did
not previously have a Spellcast trait and now require one for
your multiclass, you must use the Spellcast trait noted on
your new subclass.
Tip: When you multiclass, you must cross out one available
“take an upgraded subclass card” option on this tier of your
level up sheet, meaning you can’t gain the mastery card
for any subclass. You also cross out any other multiclass
options, as characters can only multiclass once.
Choose a domain from your new class that you don’t already
have access to. Moving forward, whenever you get to choose
domain cards, you can choose from cards that match your
additional domain at half your current level (rounded up). This
means a level 5 wizard who decides to multiclass into druid
and chooses the Sage domain could choose any Sage domain
cards of level 3 or lower.
Any attacks, spells, or other moves you use while
multiclassing are always performed at your current level. For
example, a level 7 wizard who multiclasses into a druid can
use the tier 3 “Beastform” options. If any move you get by
multiclassing asks you to use a number of dice equal to your
level, use the level on your character sheet. The half-level
restriction only applies to selecting domain cards, not the
mechanics written on them.
EXAMPLE OF LEVELING UP
A CHARACTER
Aliyah’s party has just advanced to level 2 and the group
is leveling up together. Aliyah finds the warrior class guide
to bring Tabby up to level 2.
• First, Aliyah updates Tabby’s level to “2” at the top of
her character sheet.
• Aliyah then takes her level achievements. She adds
a new Experience for Tabby. Because Tabby has
been doing a lot of acrobatics and daring jumps,
she decides to give her the Always Land on My Feet
Experience. This is a new Experience, so it starts
with a +2 modifier. Afterward, she increases Tabby’s
Proficiency to 2 (because she gets a permanent +1
bonus at level 2) and fills in one of the circles in the
Proficiency section of her character sheet to reflect
the change.
• Next, she looks at the advancement options for levels
2 to 4. She knows she wants to increase Tabby’s
Agility, since that’s her primary trait for combat. She
marks “Gain a +1 bonus to two unmarked character
traits and mark them.” Aliyah chooses Agility and
Instinct, raising each by 1 (Tabby now has an Agility
of +3 and an Instinct of +2), then marks the circle
attached to each trait as a reminder that they can’t be
raised again until Tabby hits level 5 and clears marks
on all traits.
• Following that, Aliyah marks “Permanently gain one
Stress slot.” She looks at the Stress section of Tabby’s
character sheet and fills in the outline of one of the
dotted squares to represent Tabby’s new permanent
Stress slot. That means she'll be able to withstand
more strain during play.
• She then goes to Tabby’s damage thresholds and
gains a permanent +1 bonus to both from her level
up, increasing her Major threshold from 7 to 8 and
her Severe threshold from 14 to 15. Additionally,
she updates the damage bonus from her “Combat
Training” class feature to +2, as the bonus is equal to
her level.
• Lastly, Aliyah asks for the domain decks for Blade and
Bone to pick a new domain card at level 2 or lower. At
level 2, her options in the Blade deck are “Reckless”
and “A Soldier’s Bond.” Her choices from the Bone are
“Strategic Approach” and “Ferocity.” Aliyah considers
the option to gain and give Hope with “A Soldier’s
Bond.” Since Tabby’s Knowledge trait is only 0, she
doesn't think “Strategic Approach” is a good choice.
In the end, she settles on “Reckless” to give Tabby a
better chance of hitting her opponents.
Now Tabby is ready to continue her journey as a
level 2 warrior! Now make the level up drawer better with the above info!
